# University of Michigan - Masters in Applied Data Science
## Course Summary

Note my background and circumstance: Basic Python experience, prior exposure to ML, full time job, workout 30 mins/day, newborn child. Previous bachelor's in Nuclear Physics and Master's in Mechanical Engineering. 8 years of working fulltime prior to enrollment.

**SIADS 501 - Being a Data Scientist**
I found this course to be pretty good, but a lot of reading and writing. The course gives an overview of various data science topics and perspectives and has some good readings. The writing assignments were a little weird in my personal opinion. Overall the course was a good way to orient yourself for the rest of the MADS program, and to meet some new people in the program directly.

**SIADS 502 - Math Methods I**
The instructor was pretty good but there was a disconnect, in my opinion, between the assignments and the lectures. The lectures are very theoretical, fast-paced, and surface level. It was more of a "review" of different mathematical concepts rather than truly teaching them. The assignments were short but usually had 1 or 2 difficult problems on it. I learned a lot in Week 1 but Weeks 3 and 4 were more abstract. Overall I wish the lectures covered more of actually *applying* the math methods to real world datasets. The office hours were great with TA Ben Merrill.

**SIADS 505 - Data Manipulation**
The course was good. The lectures mapped to the assignments pretty well and the topic is very useful for data science. I wish there were more pandas practice assignments, but Week 4 was pretty good for practicing. The lecturer, Chris Brooks, does a good job. The assignments took me about 8 hours on average and required some good critical thinking. My only suggestions for this course is: more pandas practice!
